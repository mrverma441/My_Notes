       //Ramu is completely dependent on geeta 
       //He cant perform his task without geeta
       //This is called dependency 
       //When one class is dependent on other
       //If we tried to create object by using new keyword then
       our software or application will become highly coupled.
       //Here we gonna perform dependency injection action of spring framework
       It has the ability to create the object of any class and then inject it
       to other class where actually it is required.
       This whole process is called Inversion of control
       when we provide the control of object creation to the spring
       framework and then spring create the object of all dependency
       dynamically at run time then,this whole techniuqe is called 
       Inversion of Control(IOC)

 *UI layer-To handle the request->
 *Business/Services Layer-for Writing business logic->
 *Data Access Layer -To access the data->
 *Database
 *ProductController-Acception the requests,It will use the product service code and logics
 *ProductService-Business service logics will be there
 *ProductDao-It can direct contact to database,we will use DAO in Productservice
