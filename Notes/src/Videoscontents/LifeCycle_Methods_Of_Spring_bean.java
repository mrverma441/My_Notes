/*
 * Spring provide two important methods to every bean automatically.
 1-public void init()-For initialization,loading config,connecting db
 webservice etc
 {
 }
 2-public void destroy()-for destroy,for clean up code.
 {
 }
 We can change the name of these methods but signature must be same.
 
 Life cycle-
 first of all we will provide a bean class to our spring ioc container
 And then we will provide configuration xml file to spring ioc container.
 it will create object first
 then it will set the values of properties
 then it will call init method
 then we read and use the bean
 then it will call destroy
 this call will be for clean up code
 ----------Configure technique------------
 XML
 Spring interface
 Annotation
